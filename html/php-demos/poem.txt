Moonlight reflects off the front of my bed.             床前明月光，
Could it actually be the frost on the ground?           疑是地上霜。
I look up to view the bright moon,                      举头望明月，
And look down to reminisce about my hometown.           低头思故乡。

                                        Lǐbái                 李白
